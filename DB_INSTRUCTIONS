Setting up postgres

- installation of postgres creates a linux account called postgres
- switch to this account via sudo -i -u postgres
- now can run psql
- 'createdb tucson' created a database called tucson
- in psql can get 
  - list of users with \du
  - list of databases with \list
- create user called alex (to match the linux account I think)
  - CREATE USER alex WITH SUPERUSER CREATEDB INHERIT LOGIN REPLICATION;
- logout of postgres account (now in user alex)

- Just typing 'psql' gets this error
  psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
        Is the server running locally and accepting
        connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?


I think problem is for some reason it is looking in /tmp for stuff and 
this is wrong

- following the advice here:
  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL
  
  (1) find which socket directory and port client was looking at:
      sudo -u postgres psql -c "SHOW unix_socket_directory;"
  
      returned:
   
   unix_socket_directory 
   -----------------------
   /var/run/postgresql
   (1 row)


  (2) check which port 
      sudo -u postgres psql -c "SHOW port;"

      returned:

   port 
   ------
   5432
  (1 row)
  
- instead call psql with args: 
  psql "dbname='tucson' host=/var/run/postgresql/ port=5432"  OR
  psql "dbname='tucson' host=/var/run/postgresql/ port=5432 user='alex'"

  Get message of 
  psql: FATAL:  Peer authentication failed for user XXXXX

  for any other user

  also seems to work no matter what is given for password='  ' as long 
  as user is 'alex'

  note this is from linux user account 'alex'

- \c in postgres interactive terminal (launched by psql) tells you which
  database you are connected to as which user


Database data storage
- to find out where the actual database is stored do:
  show data_directory;
